# BinaryTreeEvenSumRange

There is only one file called evenSumRange.java. It takes two arguments. The first one is dataX and the second one is RangeX (names are arbitrary). Use the command line to execute, and it will produce the results to the screen once executed. Simply type “java evenSumRange dataX rangeX”. X is a letter variable and can be determined from the folder data, which contains some examples. You may use your own file that has the same format as the files in the data folder.

## DataX

DataX is the file that the program takes to construct a simple binary tree.

## RangeX

RangeX is the file that the program will use to add every element in the binary tree between the two variables to determine if the sum is even or odd.

## EvenSumX

The answers to any example in the data folder. You may use this file to measure the correctness of the program.

## Compilation

Use the make file by simply typing ```make``` in the project directory. This directory will contain the “src” folder. Make will generate the bin file that has the class files. 

## Execution

To run, go to the bin file that’s generated by the ```make``` command and type ```java main.evenSumRange <dataX> <rangeX>``` when the input files are in the bin. The evenSumRange file is in the main folder, and the project runs inside the bin folder that contains all the executables and input files. You may move some examples from the data folder to the bin folder if you would like to see a demonstration.
